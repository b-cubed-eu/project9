### Project 9 @ B-Cubed Hackathon 2024 - Hacking Biodiversity Data Cubes for Policy.

### Technical Questions


### Deliverables
- User survey for cubes, to identify user needs (i.e. formats needed by users). Get results by E.O.W. (Anahita)
- BioHackrxiv paper (Andrew)
- Proof of concepts for NetCDF (Taimur, Paul, Luis) and COG-GeoTIFF (Vitalii)
- Create an endpoint in sensorthings API? A standard for describing observations. (Ivette)
  
> Stick to Open Geospatial Consortium standards. 
> Open to any programming language.
